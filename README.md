## :star2: Summary

`rocks-config.nvim` extends [`rocks.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim)
with the ability to configure your plugins.

## :hammer: Installation

Simply run `:Rocks install rocks-config.nvim`,
and you are good to go!

## :books: Usage

With this extension, you can add a `[config]` table to your `rocks.toml`,
for example:

```toml
[plugins]
"neorg" = "7.0.0"
"sweetie.nvim" = "1.0.0"

[config]
plugins_dir = "plugins/"
auto_setup = false
```

### Options

#### `plugins_dir`

The subdirectory (relative to `nvim/lua`, default: `plugins`)
to search for plugin configs. You can add a `lua/plugins/` directory
to your `nvim` config, with a lua script for each plugin.

```sh
── nvim
  ├── lua
  │  └── plugins # Your plugin configs go here.
  │     └── neorg.lua
  │     └── sweetie.lua # or sweetie-nvim.lua
  ├── init.lua
```

Upon startup, for each plugin in the `rocks.toml`'s `[plugins]`
table, this module will search for a matching config module in
and load it if one is found.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Possible config file names are:
>
> - The plugin's name (as long as it is a valid module name).
> - The plugin's name with the `.[n]vim` suffix removed[^1].
> - The plugin's name with the `[n]vim-` prefix removed[^2].
> - The plugin's name with `"-"` substituted for `"."`[^3].

[^1]: For example, a config file for a plugin called `foo.nvim` could be named `foo.lua`.
[^2]: For example, a config file for a plugin called `nvim-foo` could be named `foo.lua`.
[^3]: For example, a config file for a plugin called `foo.bar` could be named `foo-bar.lua`.

If you uninstall a plugin, you can leave its config (e.g. in case
you would like to reinstall it later), and it will not cause any
problems.

#### `<plugin>.config` - Adding basic configurations to rocks.toml

Many Neovim plugins require a call to a `setup` function,
which typically takes a configuration table.
If none of the configuration options are lua functions,
you can add the config to your rocks.toml, and this plugin
will automatically call `setup` with the plugin's options.

For example, the following lua configuration:

```lua
-- lua/plugins/lualine.lua
require('lualine').setup {
  options = {
    icons_enabled = true,
    theme = 'auto',
  },
}
```

...can also be configured via rocks.toml:

```toml
# rocks.toml
[plugins.lualine.config]
options = { icons_enabled = true, theme = "auto" }
```

The `config` field can also take on the form of a string pointing to a Lua module (if you would
like to execute a one-off script in a different location to the global `plugins_dir` option):

```toml
# rocks.toml
[plugins.lualine]
config = "plugins.statusline" # Will execute `.config/nvim/lua/plugins/statusline.lua`
```

#### `auto_setup`

Some plugins that don't work without a `setup` call,
even if you are happy with the default options.
`rocks-config.nvim` provides a hack to work around this
with the `auto_setup` option (disabled by default).
If enabled, and no config is found for an installed plugin,
this module will attempt to call `require('<plugin-name>').setup()`
for you.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Enabling `auto_setup` could lead to unexpected behaviour.
> For example, if a plugin that doesn't need a `setup` call
> has configuration/initialization logic in its main module,
> it will be invoked with the call to `require`,
> potentially resulting in more eager initialization than necessary.

You can also enable/disable `auto_setup` for individual plugins
by setting `config = true` or `config = false`, respectively.

### Initialization order

rocks.nvim makes use of Neovim's built-in [initialization sequence](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#initialization),
and provides a hook that rocks-config.nvim uses to load configs
*before* any plugin scripts are sourced[^4].

[^4]: All plugins' lua APIs are available as soon as the snippet
from the rocks.nvim installer has been executed.

If you need to source a plugin's scripts eagerly (for example,
to load colorschemes), you can set the plugin's `opt = true` in
rocks.toml, and then load it with `vim.cmd.Rocks({"packadd", "<rock-name>"})` [^5]
or `require("rocks").packadd("<rock-name")`[^6].

[^5]: See `:h rocks.commands`
[^6]: See `:h rocks.lua`

## Plugin Bundles

Apart from configuration on a per-plugin basis, it's also possible to create collections of plugins
(called bundles) and configure them all in one go.

Below is an example that bundles LSP-related plugins together:

```toml
[plugins]
"neodev.nvim"= "scm"
nvim-lspconfig = { version = "0.1.7" } 

[plugins.nvim-cmp]
git = "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp" # Use the git version of nvim-cmp for the best experience.

[bundles.lsp] # Create a bundle called `lsp`
items = [
    "neodev.nvim",
    "nvim-lspconfig",
    "nvim-cmp"
]
```

Now, instead of invoking each individual configuration file for each plugin separately,
`rocks-config.nvim` will instead look for a `lua/plugins/lsp.lua` file which it will execute.
You can then place your setup code for *all three* plugins in the same file.

#### `config`

Similarly to regular plugins, a `config` field can be applied to a bundle. This `config`
field can only be a string pointing to an alternative Lua module to execute. Example:

```toml
[bundles.lsp] # Create a bundle called `lsp`
items = [
    "neodev.nvim",
    "nvim-lspconfig",
    "nvim-cmp"
]
config = "bundles.language_support"
```

Instead of looking inside `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`, `rocks-config.nvim` will now search for
a file in `lua/bundles/language_support.lua`.

#### `load_opt_plugins`

By default, `rocks-config.nvim` will not load configs for

- plugins with `opt = true`
- or plugins that have been marked as `opt`, e.g. by rocks-lazy.nvim.

It will also not load bundles that contain a plugin that matches the above criteria.

You can either override this behaviour by setting `load_opt_plugins = true`,
or you can load the config for a plugin using the `configure(name)` function:

```lua
require("rocks-config").configure("foo.nvim")
vim.cmd.packadd("foo.nvim")
```

## Neovim configuration

You can also use `rocks-config.nvim` to set various Neovim options
in your rocks.toml.

Here is an example:

```toml
[config]
colorscheme = "kanagawa"

[config.options]
number = true
relativenumber = true
hlsearch = true
completeopt = 'menu,menuone,noinsert,fuzzy,preview,noselect'
# ...
```
